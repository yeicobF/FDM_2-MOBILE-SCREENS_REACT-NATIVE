# SCHOOL SUBJECT FOR WHICH THIS WAS MADE

    - This was made for:
      - Fundamentos de Desarrollo MÃ³vil
        - 6SEM - 1 PARTIAL [2020 - 2021/B]

# EXPLANATION
    
    - This is a project where I had to replicate 2 mobile layouts which were
      made in Figma by the teacher.

    - The 2 screens should be linked for 1 extra point.

    - This is made using React Native in JavaScript.

## LAYOUTS LOCATION
    
    folder: final-layouts-objective
        - Google Pixel 2 - 1.pdf
        - Google Pixel 2 - 5.pdf
# WHAT I USED

    - I used ESLint with Airbnb coding style conventions with some own
      personalized rules according to what I like. This was not asked by the
      teacher.

    - Expo Developer Tools to see the changes either in web or in the Android
      device.
